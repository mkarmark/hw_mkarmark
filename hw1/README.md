- All codes compile properly 
- Palindrome has a commandline argument that is the string which the program studies is or is not a palindrome
- Question 5 has a commandline argument that is the name of the file that the program is printing backwards
- TommyTrojan has two commandline arguments that are the names of the input and output file that the program is using
- Palindrome is designed to detect aXA as not a palindrome, given X is a palindrome and a and A are lowercase and uppercase letters. 
- Question 5 reverses the words recurisively so no memory is dynamically allocated in this code
- Tommy Trojan assumes that all integers are within the integer range
